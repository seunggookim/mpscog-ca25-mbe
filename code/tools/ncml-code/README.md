# ncml-code
Code repository for internal sharing and development in Research Group for NeuroCognition of Music and Language [(NCML)](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neurocognition-of-music-and-language.html) at Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, Frank am Main [(MPIEA)](https://www.ae.mpg.de/).

## Tip 1
Put your scripts or code packages to share in appropriate language/interpreter directories. Create one if you don't find it (eg. `./latex/`, `./tsch/`, `./r/`, `./spss/`, ...)

## Tip 2
Do many tests as possible before you use it for real. Give simple toy examples to the function and check if it returns what you expect. Please let author(s) know if you find any strange behaviors.

## Tip 3
Make small commits with "informative" comments. Also, make a commit before you try out a new idea (or create a branch).

## Tip 4
When you create a new directory, create `README.md` in it (and give a short description) so that others can have ideas what's going on there.

## Tip 5
When you use this as a submodule in your repo. Don't forget to run:
```
$ git submodule update --remote
```
