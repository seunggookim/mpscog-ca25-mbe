[Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)](https://mturk.com) "is a crowdsourcing marketplace that makes it easier for individuals and businesses to outsource their processes and jobs to a distributed workforce who can perform these tasks virtually".

MTurk supports an application programming interface (API), which means you don't have to click thousands of times to send a same message to all participants (a.k.a. "workers" in MTurk) but executing a few lines of Python code will do the job for you. Mostly based on [Amazon Mturk blog](https://blog.mturk.com/tutorials-api/home).
