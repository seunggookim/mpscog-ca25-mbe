This Git repo is to distribute pedagogical materials for a workshop given in Dec 5, 2024, Berlin.

## Title
Music, Brain, and Emotions: An Engaging Self-Experiment

## Instructor
Dr. Seung-Goo Kim (Research Group Neurocognition of Music and Language, Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics), <mailto:seung-goo.kim@ae.mpg.de>

## Abstract
While the affective effect of music has been long recognized in every human community, it remains unclear how abstract patterns of sounds evoke vivid and intense emotions. This workshop is designed to delve into our current understanding of the neural mechanisms behind music-evoked emotions. Importantly, participants will engage in a live experiment that provides a personal experience of music-induced emotions, followed by hands-on analysis of their behavioral responses. No prior knowledge of musicology is necessary, though a basic familiarity with any scripting language is helpful. Additional resources will be provided for those interested in further exploring the neuroscience of music. Ultimately, this workshop aims to inspire emerging researchers in neuroscience who are drawn to music and aesthetic experiences more broadly.
